This analysis investigates the factors influencing the medical insurance charges using a data set of 1,338 patients
containing demographic information, lifestyle attributes and health metrics, including Age,Sex, Number of children,
Smoking status, BMI, Region of Residence, and corresponding Insurance Cost. The objective was to identify significant
determinants of insurance charges and explore predictive modeling approaches. Data preprocessing included
handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and exploratory data analysis to uncover trends and correlations.
Regression techniques were applied to quantify the impact of each factor, with particular focus on the roles of
smoking and BMI. However, results indicate that smoking status, BMI, and age are the most substantial predictors of
higher insurance costs, followed by number of children and region of the patient, while other factors showed little or
no influence. These findings provide valuable insights for insurance pricing strategies and highlight the importance of
health-related behaviors in managing medical expenditure risk.
