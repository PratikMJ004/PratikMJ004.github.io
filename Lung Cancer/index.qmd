The project utilizes a comprehensive data set of 228 patients, diagnosed with advanced Lung Cancer, to
examine the clinical and nutritional factors influencing survival outcomes. Employing survival analysis techniques,
we investigate how variables such as, Age, Sex, Time to event, ECOG performance scores, Karnofsky
Scores (both by Patients and Physicians), Meal calorie intake and Weight loss contribute to patient survival
status. The analysis aims to identify significant predictors and their interaction with the outcome variable. We
also aim to explain the outcome variable by modeling it against plausible predictors. Moreover, we will also
try to provide some actionable insights for improving patient care in clinical practice, thus highlighting the
importance of integrating patientâ€™s data on numerous factors, possible.
